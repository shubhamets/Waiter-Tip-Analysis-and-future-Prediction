# Waiter-Tip-Analysis-and-future-Prediction

Tipping waiters for serving food can be influenced by various factors such as the type of restaurant, the size of your group, the quality of service, and the total amount of your bill. Analyzing waiter tips is a popular case study in data science, involving the prediction of tips given to a waiter for their service in a restaurant. If you are interested in learning how to approach this case study, this article will guide you through the process of predicting waiter tips using machine learning. The prediction involves analyzing a range of features such as the day of the week, time of day, and even the waiter's level of experience, to accurately predict the amount of tip a waiter might expect to receive.

Data set: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/tips.csv

The data set contains seven colums 
total_bill: Total bill amount
tip: Tip for the waiter
sex: 
smoker: whether the person smoked or not
day: day of the week
time: lunch or dinner
size: number of people in a table

Intitly we uploaded the data using panada library and cleaned it for our analysis. 

The primary analysis found that the majority of tips are given on Saturdays, and the amount of tip increases with the bill amount. However, the data shows that 67.6% of the tips were given by males compared to 32.4% by females. The data also shows that the majority of the tips received were for bill amounts between $10 and $30. When considering the number of people at a table, the majority of tips were received from couples or 2 people. All this analysis is provided in the code attached to this project.
